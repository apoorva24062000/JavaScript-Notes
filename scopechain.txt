Lexical Enviornment:


Code:

function a(){
console.log(b);
}
var b = 10;
a(); 


OUTPUT: 10

we will try to find out b in function a. (functional scope).
then it will search b in global scope.

SCOPE- is the space where we can access specific variable /function in our code.


CODE:

function a(){
    var b = 10;
    c();
    function c(){

    }
}
a();

LEXICAL ENVIORNMENT :

It is created whenever execution context is created.
LOCAL MEMORY + LEXICAL ENVIORNMENT OF PARENT.

LEXICAL means where it is present physically.



in above code , c() is lexically inside function a().
it will have access to it's local memory and lexical enviornment of function a().

a() is lexically inside global scope.


SCOPE CHAIN:

it is the chain of lexical enviornment.
it defines whether a function or variable is present inside scope or not.

in above code , c() has acces sto it's local memory + lexical enviornment of function a() + global scope.
